# Awesome Drum Machine

This is my implementation of a drum machine.

## Features

- Dynamic BPMs (+ BPM -)
- Multiple channels
- Different instruments? Yup!
- Plays patterns n'sync with BPMs
- Want to heare how it sound alone? Solo the channels you want
- Want some silence? Use the M button to mute channels
- You don't need that instrument any more? Remove it!
- Tests? done!

## TODOs: Coming up next

- Change volume of steps (the UI is done, logic is missing)
- More steps in channels
