# Awesome Drum Machine :musical_note:

This is my implementation of a drum machine to play different patterns at different BPMs

## Features

:sparkles: Dynamic BPMs (+ BPM -)  
:sparkles: Multiple channels  
:sparkles: Different instruments? Yup!  
:sparkles: Plays patterns n'sync with BPMs  
:sparkles: Want to heare how it sound alone? **Solo** the channels you want  
:sparkles: Want some silence? Use the M button to **mute** channels  
:sparkles: You don't need that instrument any more? Remove it!  
:sparkles: Tests? done!  

## TODOs: Coming up next

:star: Change volume of steps (the UI is done, logic is missing)  
:star: More steps in channels
